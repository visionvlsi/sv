# Inheritance

 Inheritance is a concept in OOP that allows us to extend

 " a class to create another class and have access to all the properties and methods of the original 
 parent class from the handle of a new class object.
 The idea behind this scheme is to allow developers add in new properties and methods into the new class while 
 still maintaining access to the original class members.
 This allows us to make modifications without touching the base class at all. "
